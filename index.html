        <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
        <p>The assignments and feedback helped me understand what exactly I was doing.</p>

        <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
        <p>I wish the classes were at least two days to understand and properly review what we would be working on for that week.</p>

        <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1>
        <p>Yes, this course felt like a continuation of the first course. It helped me to better understand a lot of the concepts from the first class.</p>

        <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
        <p>Majority of was more like a review and how to apply them in a different ways. HTML course glanced over some of these concepts. The CSS course expanded on them.</p>
